Due to the controversy around PayPal Honey, people are now concerned about their privacy.

We should build a platform which fulfills the PayPal Honey's goal and does indeed care about its users.

**Open Honey** is a completely open source project, meaning that you can join us to help us recreate the Honey's infrastructure.

Long live open source!
